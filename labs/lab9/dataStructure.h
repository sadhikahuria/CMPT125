/* 
 * dataStructure.h
 *
 * Provides a data structure made of a doubly-headed singly-linked list (DHSL) 
 * of unsorted elements (integers) in which duplicated elements are allowed.
 * 
 * A DHSL list is comprised of a single variable of data type list_t
 * and zero or more elements (each element stored in a node variable of data
 * type element_t). The struct list_t contains a pointer (called "head") to 
 * the first element in the list and a pointer (called "tail") to the last 
 * element of the list. If the list is empty, both pointers are set to NULL. 
 * The first element (node in the list) contains a pointer to the "next" element,
 * and so on. The last element in the list has its "next" pointer set to NULL.
 *
 * The interface of this data structure includes several utility 
 * functions that operate on this data structure.
 *
 * Precondition: Functions that operate on such data structure
 *               require a valid pointer to it as their first argument.
 * 
 * Do not change this dataStructure.h file.
